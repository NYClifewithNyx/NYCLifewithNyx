## 🧭 About Me

Based in **New York City**, I work as a **Commercial, Residential and SBA Loan Officer & Team Lead** at a Korean-affiliated bank, managing complex credit processes and structuring multimillion-dollar deals.  
Outside of finance, I build **systems that think and run by themselves** — from **AI automation workflows (n8n)** to **data-driven Notion templates** that simplify work and decision-making.

I’ve lived in NYC for over **20 years**, balancing corporate leadership, hands-on automation, and entrepreneurial experimentation. My approach blends precision from finance, logic from engineering, and creativity from system design.
